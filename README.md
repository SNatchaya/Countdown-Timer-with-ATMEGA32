# Countdown-Timer-using-ATMEGA32

This mini-project is the countdown timer using ATMEGA32 through Proteus software. You can set the countdown time by entering the number of times through the keypad. All settings are displayed on the LCD screen. After the setup is complete, the countdown time will appear on the 7-segment screen, indicating the countdown timer has begun. When the countdown is complete, a sound will go off and the LCD will display "countdown timer done".
